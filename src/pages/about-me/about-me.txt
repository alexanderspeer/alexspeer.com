Hello! My name is Alexander Speer, and I am a senior at Columbia University specializing in Neural Engineering. My interest in the brain is equal parts scientific and personal, grounded in moments that revealed just how real its mysteries can be.

I was in high school when I witnessed my father's first seizure. The root of the word "epilepsy" means "to be seized," and standing at his bedside, I felt seized too – not just by fear, but by a profound need to understand what was happening. Since then, I've tried to orient my life toward engineering solutions to such disorders.

Currently, I work in Columbia's <a href="https://ueil.bme.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 1px;">Ultrasound and Elasticity Imaging Laboratory (UEIL)</a>, where I study focused ultrasound neuromodulation to understand pain and neural control. I also lead as Head of Events & Experiences at <a href="https://neuro-nyc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 1px;">NeuroNYC</a>, connecting researchers, founders, and students across New York's neurotech scene.

My work spans brain–computer interface design, neural signal processing, and machine learning, with my long-term goals focused on developing technologies that restore sensory function and alleviate neurological disorders.

Another passion of mine is ancient history. Ever since I first read about Alexander the Great, I've had a bit of a one-sided feud with him. He may have claimed the epithet "the Great" a bit prematurely; I'm hoping to earn mine through the slow and careful conquest of neurons, not nations.

Let’s see how I stack up against my predecessor so far:
